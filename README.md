### ion_conductance_final.ipynb  is a jupyter notebook . 
### just download and upload to jupyter and run the cells 
### the notebook plots the conductance of Sodium and Pottasium at different voltages 


### Matlab Potassium , Matlab Sodium folders have a function and data file 
### named dxdt_n.m and HH_potassium_current.m  / HH_sodium_current.m 
### load the data and running the function would generate the plots for - 
### Sodium and Pottasium conductance at different voltage
